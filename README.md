# Kejani Project

Welcome to the Kejani project! This project aims to develop a house hunting website where we guide people on their quest for a home. The project is built using Django, JavaScript, and other web technologies.

## Project Description

The Kejani project is developed to address the challenges and requirements of house hunting. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to search for homes, view property details, and connect with real estate agents. The project includes the following features:

- User registration and authentication: Users can create accounts and authenticate to access the platform.

- Home search and filtering: Users can search for homes based on location, price range, number of bedrooms, and other criteria.

- Property listings: The platform displays detailed property listings with images, descriptions, amenities, and contact information.

- Saved searches and favorites: Users can save their searches and favorite properties for future reference.
